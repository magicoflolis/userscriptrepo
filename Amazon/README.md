## Description

Amazon doesn't make the country of origin of products by third party vendors very visible.
This userscript fetches and displays the country of origin at the start of the product title.
Hover over flag to see country and Vendor name.

This script was initially developed to make boycotting the CCP more easy after repeated disappointments with purchased products and the ongoing human rights violations of the chinese communist party.

## Changes

* Shorten includes from 5 to 2.
* Added amazon.ca as an exclude.
* Various small code improvements.

### Original Userscript

* [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/416635)
